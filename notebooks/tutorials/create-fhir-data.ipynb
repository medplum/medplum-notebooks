    "[Patient](https://docs.medplum.com/api/fhir/resources/patient) and a [ServiceRequest](https://docs.medplum.com/api/fhir/resources/servicerequest) sounds simple, but there are several nuances. If the [Patient](https://docs.medplum.com/api/fhir/resources/patient) already exists, a new one should not be created.

If that MRN exists, then a new patient should not be created. In a lab workflow, it is common for a lab to serve patients repeatedly. In this case where there is already a patient in the system, it would be incorrect (and confusing) to make a new patient record.\n"
